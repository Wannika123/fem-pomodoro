## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   Set a pomodoro timer and short & long break timers
-   Customize how long each timer runs for
-   See a circular progress bar that updates every minute and represents how far through their timer they are
-   Customize the appearance of the app with the ability to set preferences for colors and fonts

## My process

### Built with

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   TypeScript
-   Web Audio API

### What I learned

I also add tick sound when the clock is counting down, and alarmsound when the timer is done. I'm glad to improve my Web Audio API skill.

### Useful resources

-   [Height Enigma](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/height-enigma/) - This helps me understand more why sometimes CSS won't work as expected. But it's still frustrating anyway.
-   [Circular Progress Bar](https://codepen.io/KrzysiekF/pen/bGdRaLr)
